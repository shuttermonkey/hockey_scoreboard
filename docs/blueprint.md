## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Intense blue (#3F51B5), evoking reliability and energy appropriate for competitive streaming.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#212121), sets a high-contrast, modern, and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Vibrant purple (#9C27B0), used to draw attention to important interactive elements.
- Use a clean, sans-serif font optimized for screen display. The typeface should be monospaced so that changes in numbers do not cause changes in the width of the element on the scoreboard.
- Use flat, minimalist icons for the control panel that are universally understandable.
- The main scoreboard should clearly present all the game information and feature team colors
- Use subtle transition effects to indicate changes in score, timer, or penalty status.
